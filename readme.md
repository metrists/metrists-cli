## Getting Started

Create a new directory and execute the following command:

```bash
npx metrists watch --example --noob
```

Modify the markdown files. You can then publish your book:

```
npx metrists publish
```

That's it. You can push your files to a repository and connect your CI/CD pipeline. From now, every time you push to your repository, Metrists will automatically publish your book.
